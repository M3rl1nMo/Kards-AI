"""Materialize deterministic native-text parsing into the reviewed rule store.

This tool is the *derived-data* generator (it is NOT the simulator execution
core). It parses every card with ``RuleParser`` and writes the reviewed rule
store ``data/rules/card_rules.json`` that ``NativeRuleEngine`` loads.

Honest-status rule (per the handoff task book):
  A card is marked ``implemented`` only when *every* parsed action maps to a
  kind the execution layer actually handles. If any action kind is not executed
  by ``native.py`` (``NativeRuleEngine``) or ``resolver.py`` (``EffectResolver``),
  the card is downgraded to ``partial`` and the gap is recorded in
  ``unresolved_fragments``. This keeps the invariant that an ``implemented``
  entry carries no ``unresolved_fragments``, and that "playable without crashing"
  is never mistaken for "rule implemented".

# ── HONEST execution coverage ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The previous extract_executable_kinds() scanned source files for
# `kind == "X"` strings and considered every match "executable".  This was
# fundamentally dishonest: native.py contains a 30-kind catch-all at line 450
# that writes dead `unit.status[kind] = True` data for control_effect,
# special_effect, hq_effect, and 27+ other kinds.  None of that status data
# is ever consumed by any downstream game rule.  Similarly, aura_buff applies
# stat changes blindly to *all* friendly units regardless of scope/type/
# condition, which is incorrect for virtually every card it touches.
#
# _GENUINELY_EXECUTED_KINDS is the hand-maintained source of truth.  A kind
# only enters this set when its handler in native.py or resolver.py produces
# a real, verifiable game state change that is consumed by downstream rules
# (damage pipeline, deployment pipeline, combat, cost calculation, etc.).
# Adding a kind here without the corresponding verification test is forbidden.
